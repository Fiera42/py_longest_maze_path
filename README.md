## About:

An attempt at making an algorithm that finds the longest path in a given maze

## Current algorithm:

- Find a descent path using a wave function collapse approach
- Pick two random points on the path
- Try to generate a longer path between those two points

## Possible improvements:

- Pick points of interest instead of random points?
- Replace the points with a sliding window?
